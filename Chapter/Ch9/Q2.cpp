/*  
  Extend the previous program to display the area of circles. 
  This requires addition of a new derived class 'circle' that computes the area of a circle. 
  Remember, for a circle we need only one value, its radius, but the get_data() function in
  the base class requires two values to be passed. 
  (Hint: Make the second argument of get_data() function as a default one with zero value.)
