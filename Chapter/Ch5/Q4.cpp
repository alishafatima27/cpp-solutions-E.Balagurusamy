/* Modify the class and program of Exercise 5.2 such that the program would be able to add two vectors 
   and display the resultant vector. (Note that we can pass objects as function arguments.) 
*/

/*Q2  Write a class to represent a vector (a series of float values). Include member functions to perform the following tasks:

   (a) To create a vector
   (b) To modify the value of a given element
   (c) To multiply by a scalar value
   (d) To display the vector in the form (10, 20, 30, ...)

   Write a program to test your class.
