/*  Define a class String that could work as an user-defined string type. 
    Include constructors that will enable us to create uninitialized string

   String s1; // string with length 0
   and also to initialize an object with a string constant at the time of creation like

   String s2("Well done!");

   Include a function that adds two strings to make a third string. Note that the statement
   s2 = s1;
   will be perfectly reasonable expression to copy one string to another.

   Write a complete program to test your class to see that it does the following tasks:

      (a) Creates uninitialized string objects.
      (b) Creates objects with string constants.
      (c) Concatenates two strings properly.
      (d) Displays a desired string object.
