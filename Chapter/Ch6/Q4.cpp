/*  Improve the system design in Exercise 6.3 to incorporate the following features:
       (a) The price of the books should be updated as and when required. 
           Use a private member function to implement this.
       (b) The stock value of each book should be automatically updated as soon as the transaction is completed.
       (c) The number of successful and unsuccessful transactions should be recorded for the purpose of statistical analysis.
           Use static data members to keep count of transactions.
