/* 
An election is contested by five candidates. The candidates are numbered 1 to 5 and 
the voting is done by marking the candidate number on the ballot paper. 
  
Write a program to read the ballots and count the votes cast for each candidate using an array variable count. 
In case, a number read is outside the range 1 to 5, the ballot should be considered as a 'spoil ballot', and 
the program should also count the number of spoiled ballots.
