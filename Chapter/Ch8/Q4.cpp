/* The database created in Exercise 8.3 does not include educational information of the staff. 
   It has been decided to add this information to teachers and officers (and not for typists)
   which will help the management in decision making with regard to training, promotion, etc. 
   Add another data class called education that holds two pieces of educational information, namely, 
   highest qualification in general education and highest professional qualification. 
   This class should be inherited by the classes teacher and officer. 
   Modify the program of Exercise 8.3 to incorporate these additions.
